## Project terms and conditions
Our company has been approached by an animal shelter from Astana that wants to help people who are thinking about taking a dog or cat home. For many of their clients, this is their first experience, and they receive so many requests every day that they don't have time to process them manually.

The shelter management asked us for help: they asked us to write a Telegram bot that could answer popular questions people have about what they need to know and be able to do to get an animal from the shelter.

The shelter volunteers also asked the new owners to send a daily report on how the animal is adapting to the new environment. The customer also asked the bot to do this part of the work.
